# Anycubic-Predator-Duet
Config files for the Anycubic Predator Duet
Therefore, you should be able to upload these config files and be sorted.
The only wiring changes I have made to my machine is to run an extra cable for the fans to separate them into two plugs.
I will try and keep this repo up to date as I tweak my machine further.
This is for a Predator with a smart effector, duet ethernet, Haydn's Rods, 1.8 degree stepper motors and a BMG extruder

Please make sure you use this config with at least 3.01 as the bed file now uses conditional gcode
