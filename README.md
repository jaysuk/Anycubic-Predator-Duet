# Anycubic-Predator-Duet
Config files for the Anycubic Predator Duet
Therefore, you should be able to upload these config files and be sorted.
I will try and keep this repo up to date as I tweak my machine further.
This is for a Predator with a smart effector, duet ethernet, Haydn's Rods, 1.8 degree stepper motors, an E3D v6 with PT100 and a BMG extruder.
Remember to adjust the rod length settings to match yours.
